# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.


## [0.0.4] - 2023-05-08

### Added
- `Grid` enum responsible for storing arbitrary type with all the features like access by index, transposing, 
getting iterators. Furthermore, it stores the way how to treat the content (by the way, content is presented in 
struct `RawGrid` that is responsible whether `Vec<T>` or `Vec<Vec<T>>` to choose, transposing flags and so on). Such ways
listed in enum `Repr` - it's `Matrix`, `Row`, `Col`, `RowList`, `ColList`, `Failure`. The last one added in purpose
of contigious observation whether the failure happens.
- `Matr` is just wrapper upon `Grid` with `f64` instead of generic `T`. It can do arithmetic ops on top of existing possibilities.
- `AnyErr` is the error enum, that have `GridErr`, `MatrErr` variants (list will be extended).
- `GridErr` and `MatrErr` requires on creation additional information about error. As benefit, they provide `dbg`
method, that describes error in human language
- `AnyRes` works the same as built-in `Result` although it has renamed variants `Go` and `No` instead of `Ok` and `Err`
(in interests of absense names collisions). Also, it always wraps `AnyErr` in `No`.  

### Changed
- All the code have been splitten into `lib` and `bin`. First is intended to contain all reusable code.
- Structs related to matrices have been completely changed. See *added* for more information.
- _Cargo.lock_ now is in _.gitignore_ by the convention of how library dependencies works.

### Removed
- All the old staff related to matrices and `Matrixify` trait


## [0.0.3] - 2023-05-04

### Added
- `Ray` struct using `Point` and `Vector` in the given `CoordSys`
- `IdSet` uses crate `uuid`. More specifically it uses UUID standard v4. It's prohibited to mutate `Id`. 
- `EntityCore` used in every particular `Entity` (following principle Composition Over Inheritance).
It's intended to create it within `Game` instance
- Properties in `EntityCore` are set via enums `Prop` and `AnyVal`
- `Entity` is the enum with variants of different entities
- `EntityList` instance is used in `Game` for storing all related to the entities within game `Id`s 
- `Game` that responsible for storing current `CoordSys` and `EntityList` and running related scripts
- `GameObject` that stands for basic game object
- `GameCamera` with four different constructors
- Reexports into scope of namespace `engine`

### Changed
- `linalg` module renamed to `linal`
- `enums` module rightfully renamed to `errs`

### Fixed
- `VecSpace` now knows precisely whether the basis is orthogonal or not

### Dependecies
- `Uuid` crate with feauture `v4`


## [0.0.2] - 2023-04-13

### Added
- Constructors for rotational matrices

### Changed
- Global singleton ```Gramm``` matrix renamed to ```Gram``` matrix
- ```Vecspace``` struct renamed to ```VecSpace``` struct

### Fixed
- No more panic in scalar product if operands are transposed incorrectly

### Removed
- Pointless operation of addition, subtraction between ```Matrixify``` implementor and number
- Enum ```MatrixType``` that had no usages


## [0.0.1] - 2023-03-30

### Added

- ```Matrixify``` trait that intended to be implemented for each struct
that may be represented as a table of numbers
- ```Matrix``` struct and Matrixify implementation for it
- ```Vector``` struct and Matrixify implementation for it
- Arithmetic operations such as addition, subtra—Åtion, multiplication,
division between ```Matrix``` and ```Vector```, between them two and numbers
- Scalar product between two ```Vectors``` in basis of vector space or without it
- Vector product between two ```Vectors```
- ```VecSpace``` struct contains basis
- ```Point``` struct as just another representation of Vector in basis
- ```CoordSys``` struct defined with ```VecSpace``` and initial ```Point```
- Global singletones: matrix of bilinear form, actual coordinate system,
corresponding Gram matrix
