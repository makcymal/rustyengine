# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.0.2] - 2023-04-13

### Added
- Constructors for rotational matrices

### Changed
- Global singleton ```Gramm``` matrix renamed to ```Gram``` matrix
- ```Vecspace``` struct renamed to ```VecSpace``` struct

### Fixed
- No more panic in scalar product if operands are transposed incorrectly

### Removed
- Pointless operation of addition, subtraction between ```Matrixify``` implementor and number
- Enum ```MatrixType``` that had no usages

## [0.0.1] - 2023-03-30

### Added

- ```Matrixify``` trait that intended to be implemented for each struct
that may be represented as a table of numbers
- ```Matrix``` struct and Matrixify implementation for it
- ```Vector``` struct and Matrixify implementation for it
- Arithmetic operations such as addition, subtra—Åtion, multiplication,
division between ```Matrix``` and ```Vector```, between them two and numbers
- Scalar product between two ```Vectors``` in basis of vector space or without it
- Vector product between two ```Vectors```
- ```VecSpace``` struct contains basis
- ```Point``` struct as just another representation of Vector in basis
- ```CoordSys``` struct defined with ```VecSpace``` and initial ```Point```
- Global singletones: matrix of bilinear form, actual coordinate system,
corresponding Gram matrix
